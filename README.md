\The file you upload must be a .zip file that contains the following files: README.txt,
for C++: Agents/b07901XXX.h
for Python: Agents/pyb07901xxx.h and Agents/pyb07901xxx.py
1. Do not submit executable files (.exe) or files for linker(.o, .obj). Files with names in wrong format will not be graded. You must remove any system functions or windows-only functions, such as system ("pause"), in your code if you use it.
2. In README.txt file, you need to describe which compiler you choose in this homework and how to compile it (if it is in a “project” form).
3. In your .cpp files, we suggest you write comments as detailed as you can. If the code does not work properly, code with comments can get partial points. It will be good for the TAs to read your code as well as for your future reference and maintenance.
